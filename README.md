An up-to-date remix of the nom-tam-fits pure Java library for reading and writing FITS files. FITS, the Flexible Image Transport System, is the format commonly used in the archiving and transport of astronomical data.

This is a remix of the original nom-tam-fits repo, which has gone unmaintained for the last few years. It switches to GitHub Actions for CI, and incorporates
recent bug fixes that were submitted as pull requests to the base repo.
