# nom-tam-fits Remix

An up-to-date remix of the nom-tam-fits pure Java library for reading and writing FITS files. FITS, the Flexible Image Transport System, is the format commonly used in the archiving and transport of astronomical data.

This is a fork of the original nom-tam-fits repo, and includes a number of bug fixes beyond those in the base repo. Unfortunately the base repository has gone unmaintained for the last few years. Hence, this
fork is intended to provide up-to-date code and releases until the main repository becomes active again.

This fork switches from Travis CI to GitHub Actions, and from Coveralls to Codecov.io for better Actions integration. It also incorporates recent bug fixes that were submitted as pull requests to the base repo.

Full documentation of the library can be found at the nom-tam-fits [Project Site](http://nom-tam-fits.github.io/nom-tam-fits/ "nom-tam-fits project site").
